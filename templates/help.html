        <h2><i class="fas fa-pen-nib"></i> Writing an Entry</h2>
        <p>From the dashboard, choose "Make an Entry". You can either write for today or select a custom date from the weekly calendar view. The editor allows you to write using Markdown for formatting, such as using `#` for headers or `*` for italics and bold.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Understanding Memories</h2>
        <p>Your memories give your AI companion context about your life. Click the brain icon (<i class="fas fa-brain"></i>) in the header to open them. There are two types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your Memories:</strong> This is your space. Add core facts about yourself, your life, and your preferences (e.g., "My best friend's name is Sarah."). The AI treats this as the absolute truth.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Learned:</strong> As you write, the AI will pick up on new details (like the name of a pet or a new hobby) and add them here automatically. You can review, edit, or delete these.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> The Journal View</h2>
        <p>This is your timeline. You can navigate between weeks using the arrows. Days with entries are filled in, while empty days are a prompt to write. Click any day to read or write an entry for that date.</p>
